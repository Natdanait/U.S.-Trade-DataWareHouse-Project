# ðŸ§­ Data Journey

The **U.S. Trade Data Warehouse Project** integrates official U.S. trade data from multiple sources into one analytical flow.  
It connects the entire process â€” from **raw data collection** to **interactive policy dashboards** â€” to support consistent and policy-driven trade analysis.

### ðŸ”¹ Overview
- **Source:** Monthly import and export data from the **U.S. Census Bureau** and **USITC**, organized by country and HTS 10-digit product codes.  
- **Storage & Processing:** Data is uploaded to **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** and processed in **BigQuery**, where it is cleaned, standardized, and linked with policy datasets such as *Section 232* and *Reciprocal Tariff lists*.  
- **Output:** The final datasets feed directly into **Power BI dashboards**, allowing trade analysts to explore trends, evaluate policy impacts, and visualize results at both product and country levels.

Each dataset remains **traceable to its original source** for validation and audit, ensuring transparency and consistency across all analyses.

For a visual overview of the process, see the [Data Pipeline Diagram](../diagrams/Data%20pipeline%20Diagram.drawio.png).

In short, the Data Journey shows how **raw trade data becomes structured insights** â€”  
supporting accurate, transparent, and timely trade-policy analysis.
