# U.S. Trade Data Architecture & Analytics

This repository presents the **data foundation** for analyzing the international trade of the **United States**.  
It integrates official U.S. trade data and policy references into a single analytical environment — designed for trade analysts, researchers, and policymakers who seek to understand trade trends, performance, and policy impacts clearly and efficiently.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

The **U.S. Trade Data Architecture** is built to answer the most fundamental questions about U.S. international trade, such as:

- Has U.S. **import or export** increased or decreased this year?  
- What are the **top imported or exported products**?  
- Which countries are the **main trading partners**?  
- How have trade **trends changed over time**?

These represent the system’s **core analytical capabilities**, providing accurate, consistent, and ready-to-use insights on the structure and evolution of U.S. trade at both the **product** and **country** levels.

---

Over time, the database has evolved beyond basic statistics.  
By integrating **additional features** and **policy-specific dimension tables**, the system now supports **deeper, policy-driven analysis**, including:

- **Agricultural trade focus** (HS Chapters 01–23 & 40)  
- **Section 232 Tariff coverage** (Iron, Steel, Aluminum, Vehicles, etc.)  
- **Reciprocal Tariff framework** (Annex II & III lists)  
- **Country and product-level impact evaluations** under specific trade measures  

These enhancements make it possible to perform advanced analysis more **accurately**, **rapidly**, and **consistently** — for example:

> *“How have Section 232 tariffs affected imports of steel from ASEAN countries?”*  
> *“Which agricultural products are showing sustained import growth?”*

Together, these features form a **scalable and modular architecture** that grows with new data sources, trade policies, and analytical needs.

---

### Key Highlights
- Multi-level **HTS hierarchy** (10 → 8 → 6 → 4 → 2 digits)  
- Combines **monthly and year-to-date (YTD)** trade trends  
- Integrated **policy filter tables** (Section 232, Reciprocal, etc.)  
- Enables both **high-level monitoring** and **deep-dive policy evaluation**  
- Designed for **international trade analysts** and **economic policymakers**

## 🧭 Data Journey

> 🔗 See [`docs/01_data_journey.md`](docs/01_data_journey.md)

| Stage | Description |
|-------|--------------|
| **1. Data Source** | Monthly import/export data from the **U.S. Census Bureau** |
| **2. Ingestion** | Extracted via **Google Colab** and uploaded to **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)** |
| **3. Storage** | Raw parquet files organized by year, month, and trade type |
| **4. Data Warehouse** | **BigQuery** transforms raw data into clean fact and dimension tables |
| **5. Analytics** | **Power BI** connects to BigQuery for visualization, DAX modeling, and policy dashboards |

### 🗺️ Data Pipeline Overview

![Data Pipeline](Diagrams/Data%20pipeline%20Diagram.drawio.png)

**Flow Summary**

1. **U.S. Census Data** is extracted through Google Colab and uploaded to **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**.  
2. **GCS** acts as the central repository for raw monthly trade files (parquet format).  
3. **BigQuery** ingests and transforms data into structured **fact** and **dimension** tables (e.g., `fact_imp_val2`, `dim_hts10`, `bridge_sec232`).  
4. **Power BI** connects directly to BigQuery for visual exploration and policy dashboards.
