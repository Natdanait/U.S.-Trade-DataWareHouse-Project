# 🧱 U.S. Trade Data Warehouse Architecture (Colab-Driven ELT)

## 1️⃣ Executive Summary & Core Objectives

This architecture establishes a scalable platform for U.S. trade analysis, leveraging official monthly data from the **U.S. Census Bureau**.  
The entire pipeline operates within the **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, utilizing **Google Colaboratory** as the primary orchestration and transformation engine, with data stored and analyzed in **Google BigQuery**.

### Pipeline Flow
1. **Extract (E):** Data pulled directly from Census sources within a Colab notebook.  
2. **Load (L):** Raw data saved as Parquet files to **Google Cloud Storage (GCS)**.  
3. **Transform (T):** Colab/Pandas/PyArrow scripts perform cleaning and staging, followed by final loading into BigQuery Fact Tables.

## 2️⃣ Layered Data Management & Colab Workflow

The pipeline follows a three-layered data structure, with Colab notebooks driving each transformation step.

| **Layer** | **Storage Location** | **Key Process (Colab Step)** | **Purpose / Granularity** |
|:-----------|:--------------------|:-----------------------------|:---------------------------|
| 🟢 **Raw (Landing)** | ☁️ GCS (Parquet) | Data ingestion from Census files via PyArrow; minimal formatting only. | Immutable raw backup of monthly data. |
| 🟡 **Staging** | 🗄️ BigQuery | Colab reads from GCS, cleans, and consolidates all monthly files for a year into a temporary staging table (`trade_import_2025`). | Validated and consolidated yearly data. |
| 🔵 **Warehouse** | 🗂️ BigQuery | Colab joins staging data with dimensions (`dim_hts_all`, `dim_country`, etc.) and loads into permanent, partitioned fact tables. | Optimized star-schema dataset for BI analysis. |


**Key advantage:**  
Using **PyArrow** and **Parquet** allows efficient columnar reads/writes in Colab, accelerating Load and Transform phases.

## 3️⃣ Schema Design and Data Flow

### 🔹 HTS Dictionary Dimension (`dim_hts_all`)

This table forms the backbone of the product hierarchy, mapping granular 10-digit HTS codes to higher-level classifications (8-, 6-, 4-, and 2-digit).  
It acts as the **central bridge key** linking the Fact Table (trade values) to the Policy Dimension Tables (policy lists).

---

### 🟢 Policy Dimension Tables (Filters)

Policy dimension tables are modular lookup lists designed for analytical filtering.  
They are populated separately (outside the Census ingestion flow) and joined to the HTS dictionary during analysis.

**Examples:**  
- `dim_sec232_vehicle_bus` — Section 232: Heavy & Medium-Duty Vehicles  
- `dim_reciprocal_tariff` — Reciprocal Tariff (Annex II & III)  
- `dim_critical_minerals` — Critical Minerals List
